# ðŸ¦– C Project Template for VSCode

This template project is designed to expedite the process of setting up a C project. It is specifically tailored for use with the [Visual Studio Code IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and its [development container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). The chosen tools are compatible with each other and aim to alleviate the challenges typically encountered during initial project configuration. It is important to note that this setup does not assert itself as the optimal or recommended approach for working with C. As we continually learn and evolve, opinions and methodologies may shift over time. Therefore, this project offers one possible method, but feel free to customize it to suit your specific requirements.
